# NIST CSF Project

<h1>DDos Attack on a Multimedia Company</h1>




<h2>Description</h2>

Below is an incident report analysis that utilizes the knowledge of networks speficially the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) to analyze a network incident. By implementing the five core functions of NIST CSF which are to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover you can ensure organizations are protected against potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. Creating a quality incident report can improve communication and transparency with stakeholders, and improve security practices within an organization.

<h2>Scenario</h2>


You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. Your organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.

During the attack, your organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services.

The company’s cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. <i>This scenario is based on a fictional company.<i/>
